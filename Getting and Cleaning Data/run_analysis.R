# This line subsets the raw_data by all column names that contains the strings "Subject", "Activity", "mean()" and "std()".
# Variables that contain the word "Mean" somewhere along the string (i.e. the angle variable) are excluded from the subset as they 
# use a different measurement criteria than the rest of the variables.

# measurement variable for each Subject and each Activity.

# Another option is to use the aggregate function from the base package. The output is similar, but I prefer dplyr because aggregate renames 
# the grouping varaibles and creates additional ones that are not pertinent for the analysis. Uncomment to test the aggregate function.

# This line saves the tidy_data_set as a *.txt file.
